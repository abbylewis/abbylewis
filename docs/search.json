Her research aims to characterize the effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems and vice versa—how these changes may feed back to alter the global carbon cycling processes that shape Earth’s climate. At the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Abby is developing forecasts of methane emission from wetlands across the coasts of the contiguous United States to inform local and national blue carbon planning efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\nEmail: abigail.sl.lewis@gmail.com\nResearchGate | ORCID | Google Scholar\nGitHub: abbylewis\nBluesky: @aslewis.bsky.social\n\nWebsite created with Quarto based on resources by Steffi LaZerte.\nUpdated:\n\n\n[1] \"2025-01-13\""

## Outreach

### National Parks Marsh Restoration

I worked with the National Park Service to create a set of communications materials about coastal marsh restoration, including visitor center display boards and digital StoryMaps. This work was done through a [science communication fellowship](https://esa.org/programs/scip/) from the Ecological Society of America.

  <li>[Assateague Island National Seashore StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/094c032b8f2d435dbd31e5b2d49bc173)</li>
  <li>[Colonial National Historical Park StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8227e104027043dfb39bce020143b7e2)</li>
</ul>

### Flipped Science Fair

In our flipped science fair, we gave kids the power to judge graduate student science fair posters. Kids interacted with 27 graduate student presenters in small group settings, and they had the opportunity to see themselves as valued contributors in science. Meanwhile, graduate students had got training and feedback in science communication. We published a paper about the first year of this project [here](https://doi.org/10.15695/jstem/v6i1.14).

### Stream box

When the COVID-19 pandemic cancelled all in-person science outreach, I worked the [New River Land Trust](https://www.newriverlandtrust.org/) and the Virginia Tech [Stream Team](https://vtstreamteam.weebly.com/) to put together a "Stream Box" filled with information and activities that families could use to independently learn about a local stream. The Global Change Center wrote an article about this work [here](https://globalchange.vt.edu/news/news-stories/2020-21-news/new-educational-outreach-stream-box.html).

### GirlsLaunch!

GirlsLaunch! is a program at Virginia Tech that aims to combat gender biases by exposing kindergarten-aged children to female scientists. With [funding](https://support.psyc.vt.edu/news/girls-launch-brings-female-scientists-children-through-icat-funded-project) from the Virginia Tech Center for Communicating Science, I developed a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP4h2Nr5va8&list=PLjNPzLCLK0Ss0SYc4fdejp3nt8d0AtTfa) and interactive worksheet activity for the GirlsLaunch! program.

### Envirobites

[Envirobites](https://envirobites.org/) works to make environmental research accessible to non-experts. I have written [many articles](https://envirobites.org/author/alewis/) for the site, each of which takes a specific paper and breaks down the key findings.
